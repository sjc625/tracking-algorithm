 * This code was modified by David Baumann for the SPACEHAUC groundstation
 * project in 2018.
 *  Changes:
 *    * Modified Example code to work as header with implementation file
 *    * SGP4 pass by reference changed to pointers
 *    * Added function for finding next pass instead of pass list (FindNextPass)
 *    * Struct PassDetails renamed "struct passDetails" and typedefed to
 *      "PassDetails_t"
